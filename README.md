# Welcome to my technical portfolio! :alien:

This repository is a collection of projects that represent my journey and passion across various branches of engineering and software development. Each program is a reflection of the theoretical knowledge I learned, which I wanted to apply in practice. Feel free to reach out if you would like to connect via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/-irina-zhukova/) :)

## Project Directory

### 1. Embedded Programming

> Location: embedded/

This directory contains projects developed using the Arduino IDE with the ESP32 as the main microcontroller. These applications demonstrate firmware development, sensor integration, wireless communication, and IoT system design.

**IoT Jukebox**: A Wi-Fi enabled music player with remote control and customization capabilities.

**Wireless Access Control System**: A secure, biometric/RFID-based entry system with remote management.

**Study Room Monitoring System**: An occupancy and environmental monitoring solution using motion, sound, and ambient sensors.

### 2. Parallel Programming

> Location: parallel/

A collection of implementations and experiments using MPI (Message Passing Interface) on multi-node clusters. These projects focus on optimizing computational tasks, understanding parallel architectures, and improving performance through distributed algorithms.

Algorithms implemented include parallel sorting, matrix operations, and simulation workloads.

Focus on scalability, load balancing, and inter-process communication efficiency.

### 3. Rocketry

> Location: rocketry/

Documentation and design files for high-power model rockets built as part of my solid engine certification pursuits. This includes technical design, avionics, and beginner flight simulations.

Includes: openRocket files, propulsion calculations, and rocket photos.

Highlights hands-on aerospace engineering, systems integration, and safety-oriented development.

### 4. UI/UX Design Case Study

> Location: ui/

A comprehensive UI/UX case study that walks through the end-to-end process of designing a user interface—from research and wireframing to prototyping and usability testing.

Covers user research, information architecture, visual design, and interaction logic.

Demonstrates a structured, iterative design process with a focus on user-centered outcomes.
